* This Codeathon project _seeks to analyze WGS data of Colorectal cancer patients using a shortgun sequencing approach_

## Background

* *Colorectal cancer(CRC)* remains a worldwide epidemiological burden, and a leading contributor of cancer morbidity and mortality each year. 
* In 2020 alone, [CRC was responsible for an estimated 915,880 deaths](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/colorectal-cancer/statistics#). 
* The development of CRC is usually as a result of the interaction between histological, morphological, and genetic changes that accumulate over time (Simon _et al_., 2016)
* Risk factors for CRC include excessive alcohol use, smoking, old age, obesity and physical inactivity, certain deits, family history, and other genetic predispositions [3](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/colon-rectal-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html).
* Although incidence over the years have been lowering, prevalence continues as a result of certain adopoted lifestyle factors that continue to implicate the disease, even in low-risk settings, offsetting the benefits of early screening.
* The early screening and detection of CRC would allow for increased chance of proper diagnosis with improved outcomes. Late detection may be too late for normal colorectal architecture recovery, as infection might have complicated and worsened beyond current treatment.

## Aim
- [ ] To reveal the microbial composition and ecological changes in patients with colorectal cancer
- [ ] To characterize microbial implicates in Colorectal Cancer infections using shorgun metagenomes approach
- [ ] Predict conserved bacterial functions using in silico bacterial metagenomic analysis

## Objectives
- [x] Access Whole Genome Sequence data of colorectal cancer patients
- [x] Assemble and quality-check CRC metagenomes
- [x] Gene prediction, functional annotation and phylogenetic analysis

## Methodology
* Obtain WGS fecal samples (Sequence Read Archive)
* Read Quality Assessment (FastQC)
* Trimming and Filtering 
* Metagenome Assembly (metaSPades) and Quality Check of Assembled Metagenome (metaQUAST)
* Metagenome Binning
* Gene prediction and Functional Annotation
* Taxonomic Assignment (Kraken2)
* Diversity Analysis
* Taxonomic and Phylogeny Analysis
